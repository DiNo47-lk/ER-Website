          <h2>Why Small Farms will be the backbone of food security</h2>
        </div>
      </div>
    <div  class="blog3 bp">
        <p>
            Sri Lanka’s country statement to the 21st Conference of the Parties (known as COP21) to the 1992 
            United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change held in Paris in 2015 stated, “We are aware 
            that the critical Ecosystem services such as production of Oxygen, sequestering of Carbon, water 
            cycling and ambient cooling is carried out by the photosynthetic component of biomass. This is 
            being lost at an exponential rate, due to the fact that these Ecosystem Services have not been 
            valued, nor economically recognized. We would request the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
            Change (IPCC) to examine the value of photosynthetic biomass.”
        </p>
        <p>
            The most critical and valuable material in maintaining the life support system of the planet is 
            its photosynthetic biomass. Yet this material has been conspicuously under-appreciated and 
            unvalued to date. The growth of the current carbon market in addressing climate change provides 
            real benchmarks and suggests astounding market opportunities. The Analog Forestry system of farm 
            based environmental restoration emerges as a promising technology to help capitalize 
            photosynthetic biomass.
        </p> 
        <p>
            Photosynthetic biomass performs the act of primary production, the initial step in the 
            manifestation of life. The biomass so termed has the ability to increase in mass through 
            the absorption of solar or other electromagnetic radiation while releasing oxygen and water 
            vapor into the atmosphere. Respiring biomass is that component of living biomass that uses the 
            output of primary production to make the complicated biological patterns of life; it consumes 
            oxygen to power its functions and does not have photosynthetic functions itself. This distinction 
            would seem to be fundamentally important when assessing the value of biomass that is being 
            addressed. The consideration of biomass contributes to terrestrial primary production as a 
            distinct biomass pool is urgent. As outlined above, it is only photosynthetic biomass that 
            powers carbon sequestration, carbohydrate production, oxygen generation and water transformation, 
            i.e. all actions essential for the sustainability of the life support system of the planet. The 
            photosynthetic biomass in terrestrial ecosystems is largely composed of the leaves of vegetation. 
            While the photosynthetic component of marine ecosystems are comprised mostly of marine algae and 
            phytoplankton. In terrestrial systems, it is the leafy component that contributes to primary 
            production.
        </p> 
        <p>
            The sheer power of operation of the terrestrial photosynthetic system is seen when the volume 
            of water released from photosynthetic biomass is considered, at a water release rate of 100:1, 
            where over 100 molecules of water are released for each molecule of carbon dioxide absorbed by 
            the leaf. The quantity of water released annually by forests and grasslands are like aerial 
            rivers cycling about 6,250 billion tons of water into the atmosphere per annum. This quantity of 
            evaporative water not only greatly influences local cooling events, but also contributes to the 
            distribution of heat in the atmosphere. One ofe most significant consequences of transpiration by 
            terrestrial vegetation is the “cleaning” effect on groundwater, releasing round water freed of 
            the chemical pollutants that it was once burdened with. This cleaning function is hardly 
            recognized nor evaluated.
        </p>
        <p>
            The oxygen generation function too is taken for granted but in the 20th century humanity has 
            pumped increasing amounts of fossil carbon dioxide into the atmosphere by burning the carbon 
            stored in coal, petroleum and natural gas. In the process, we’ve also been consuming oxygen and 
            destroying plant life, cutting down forests at an alarming rate and thereby short circuiting the 
            cycle’s natural rebound. We’re artificially slowing down one process and speeding up another, 
            forcing a change in the atmosphere.
        </p>
        <p>
            It eems imperative that a real value be placed on photosynthetic biomass; initial computations 
            can begin by considering the current values suggested for the global market for similar 
            functions. The estimated value of the carbon market was in excess of $125 billion in 2008. 
            Thus even if we consider as current, the value of $125 billion that has been placed on containing 
            limate change, the value of photosynthetic biomass can now be addressed. Assuming that the market 
            would pay at least the value of controlling climate change to provide oxygen and clean water, the 
            93.1 billion tons of photosynthetic carbon currently in stock would be roughly worth about $1.35 
            per kilogram. This photosynthetic biomass, often considered to be too temporal in accounting for 
            carbon sequestering, is actually the most valuable component.
        </p>
        <p>
            Slowing down the loss of global terrestrial photosynthetic biomass stock is not an option – it is 
            a critical need. A massive investment must go towards incrementing the global photosynthetic 
            biomass stock. The potential value of this stock can also attract the investment to develop 
            market growth. A discussion of the models of high utility and high photosynthetic productivity is 
            urgent. The recognition and evaluation of photosynthetic biomass must become a primary driver of 
            the restoration processes discussed above. It can energize the restoration of biodiversity and 
            the restoration of environmental services.
        </p>
        <p>
            For management purposes, the photosynthetic biomass of a natural ecosystem has to be seen as a 
            continuum of native species from the early seral stages represented by annuals and short lived 
            species, to shrubs and bushes, to pioneer trees, to the mature tree dominated, old growth forest. 
            In restoration methodologies like Analog Forestry where each stage is encouraged to carry its 
            full complement of photosynthetic biomass, the management plans address the generation and 
            maintenance of the optimal levels of photosynthetic biomass in each seral stage and gain the 
            corresponding value.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is a fact that the sustainability of oxygen production is being endangered by the fossil 
            fuel driven economy. The expansion of fossil-based industry and farming at the expense of vast 
            regions of forests and seas not only destabilizes the atmosphere by accelerating global warming 
            and thereby affecting the performance of chlorophyll, but also removes the very basis of life by 
            burning the biologically created oxygen without paying for its replacement.
        </p>
        <p>
            The signs are all around. A recent study on the levels of oxygen in the ocean found that the 
            oceanic oxygen levels decreased by 2% over the last 50 years. On land, the font of oxygen are 
            the leaves of trees. Another study published in the journal Nature suggests that 15 billion trees 
            are cut down each year and the global tree count has fallen by 46% since the beginning of human 
            civilization. Considering that a tree produces 120 kg of oxygen each year this represents a 
            massive loss. But can we change the current relationship? Can we recognize the value of Primary 
            Ecosystem Services (PES) provided by these trees and assign a value to it?
        </p>
        <p>
            After many years of research, a Sri Lankan company, Earthrestoration, has developed a system to 
            invest in a facilitate the growth of the market in PES. It is such activity, like restoring our 
            ecosystems and using it to adapt to climate change, that will change the destructive road we have 
            been placed on in the name of “development” and place us on a better path to adapt to the 
            oncoming climate crisis.
        </p>
        <p>
            Climate change is real, the reason for it is “development” based on fossil energy. We have been 
            fooled into believing that greed is development and now we and our children will have to pay the 
            price of this folly, but pointing fingers at the authors of this crisis will not help. We have to 
            take responsibility for what we take out of our Global Commons and make sure we replace what we 
            use.
