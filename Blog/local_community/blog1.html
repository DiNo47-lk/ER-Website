        <h2>Why Small Farms will be the backbone of food security</h2>
      </div>

            <p>
              The ecological axiom that: ‘Energy flow through a system tends to 
              organise and simplify that system’, is abundantly clear in agriculture. As farms moved 
              from small interdependent units, bounded by fences and hedgerows, to large cropping fields 
              to accommodate machine management, we lose the biodiversity that once existed on that landscape 
              and the biomass that provided the Ecosystem Services. This sacrifice was rationalised through the 
              invocation of economic profit. The economic ‘profit’ gained by subsidies on fossil fuel and 
              uncontrolled extraction from the Global Commons. The ‘development’ of agriculture has become a 
              race to control the commodity market. 
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘We, the farmers of Sri Lanka would like to further thank the CGIAR, for taking an interest in us. 
            We believe that we speak for all of our brothers and sisters the world over when we identify ourselves 
            as a community who are integrally tied to the success of ensuring global food security. In fact it is 
            our community who have contributed to the possibility of food security in every country since mankind 
            evolved from a hunter-gather existence. We have watched for many years, as the progression of experts, 
            scientists and development agents passed through our communities with some or another facet of the 
            modern scientific world. We confess that at the start we were unsophisticated in matters of the 
            outside world and welcomed this input. We followed advice and we planted as we were instructed. 
            The result was a loss of the varieties of seeds that we carried with us through history, often 
            spanning three or more millennia. The result was the complete dependence of high input crops that 
            robbed us of crop independence. In addition, we farmers producers of food, respected for our ability 
            to feed populations, were turned into the poisoners of land and living things, including fellow human 
            beings. The result in Sri Lanka is that we suffer from social and cultural dislocation and suffer the 
            highest pesticide- related death toll on the planet. Was this the legacy that you the agricultural 
            scientists wanted to bring to us ? We think not. We think that you had good motives and intentions, 
            but left things in the hands of narrowly educated, insensitive people.’

              The diverse farm had to yield to production monoculture, which was made possible through 
              the burning of fossil fuels. Ironically the burning of fossil fuels is the major reason for 
              the current destabilised climate and threat to agriculture. One consequence of climate change 
              is the predicted rise in global temperatures. If ambient temperatures exceed 40 degrees , which 
              has become the reality in many places even today, food production will be compromised. All the 
              food we eat originates with plants and plants produce using photosynthesis. Photosynthesis, or 
              the capture of solar energy by plants, is done with chlorophyll, the thing that makes plants 
              green and chlorophyll begins to break down after 40 degrees. Landscapes whose summer 
              temperatures go beyond this limit will have smaller and smaller crops as the temperatures 
              ncrease. The only solution to this oncoming crisis, is to begin introducing trees at strategic 
              points on the landscape.

        <P>
          Trees and all other forms of vegetation cool the environment around them through the transpiration 
          process, which takes place in the leaves. The water absorbed by the roots is sent up to the leaves 
          which release it as vapor, cooling the air around it. Measurements on trees done by research 
          institutions worldwide, indicate that an average large tree produces the cooling equivalent of 
          eight room sized air conditioners running for 10 hours, a cooling yield 0f 1,250,000 Bthu per day. 
          Plantations of trees have been recoded to have daytime temperatures at least 3 degrees below the 
          ambient. This is an important aspect of Ecosystem Services that needs to be considered for adaptive 
          agriculture.
        </P>
        <p>
          Small farms which produce food with low external energy and maintain high biomass and biodiversity, 
          are the models of food production that can face the climate compromised future before us. Capital, 
          resource and energy expensive agricultural systems could fail in a high temperature future and 
          threaten global food security, we need options. One would be to encourage a consumption and 
          distribution system that facilitates small farmers to enter the market. Another would be to realise 
          the value of the ecosystem services of a farm and develop systems to measure and reward. We are all 
          aware of the future before us. Now is not the time to stand blinking like a deer facing the 
          headlights.
        </p>
        <p>
          But placing trees in and around cropping areas becomes a problem in large cropping fields designed 
          to accommodate machine management. The management of such trees and hedgerows requires needs that 
          cannot be provided without human management. Agricultural landscapes will need management that will 
          be adaptive to the changing climate. An example would be; small interdependent units bounded by 
          fences and that increase biodiversity and the biomass while providing Ecosystem Services.
        </P>
        <p>
          Investment in food security, should take climate change seriously. All new agricultural projects 
          should address the heat thresholds of the planned crops. The Sri Lankan country statement at COP 
          21 stated that :
        </p>
        <p>
          “We are aware that the optimum operating temperature of chlorophyll is at 37 deg C. In a warming 
          world where temperatures will soar well above that, food production will be severely impacted.”
        </p>
        <p>
          And that :
        </p>
        <p>
          “We are aware that the critical Ecosystem services such as; production of Oxygen, sequestering of 
          Carbon, water cycling and ambient cooling is carried out by the photosynthetic component of biomass. This is being lost at an exponential rate, due to the fact that these Ecosystem Services have not been valued, nor economically recognised.”
        </p>
        <p>
          These statements cry out for the recognition of the role that small farms will have to play in the 
          future. In a temperature compromised future, small farms with high standing biomass, through their 
          cooler temperatures will continue to produce food in heat stressed periods. If such Ecosystem 
          Services can be given a value, it will strengthen the economy of small farms and ensure local, 
          sustainable food production into the future.
        </p>
        <p>
          Small farms which produce food with low external energy and maintain high biomass and biodiversity, 
          are the models of food production that can face the climate compromised future before us. Capital,

          the value of the ecosystem services of a farm and develop systems to measure and reward. We are all 
          aware of the future before us. Now is not the time to stand about, blinking like a deer in the 
          headlights.
