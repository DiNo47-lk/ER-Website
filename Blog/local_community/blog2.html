        <h2>Right to Life –Right to toxin-free food</h2>
      </div>

    <div class="container overflow-hidden" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">

            <p>
                It is in this context that we should examine the right to life. Access to clean drinking 
                water, clean breathable air and clean, non-toxic food, must be non-negotiable and fundamental.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once these fundamental rights are acknowledged, food security and food sovereignty become 
            significant factors of sustainable development. The production of food has been the domain of 
            the farming and fishing communities, from prehistory. However, the strong links that farmers had 
            to their land are being severed by the introduction of industrial farming and the subsequent 
            ‘Green Revolution’ technological package. The traditional knowledge and genes that had sustained 
            humanity for over three thousand years are discounted and replaced with high energy-dependent, 
            biodiversity poor, toxic methods of farming, supported and financed by the international banking 
            system.
          </p>
          <p>
            The tragedy is clearly outlined in the statement from the National Farmer Federation of 
            Sri Lanka which made the following declaration to the Consultative Group in International 
            Agricultural Research (CGIAR) in 1998. They said:
          </p>
          <p>
            “We believe that we speak for all of our brothers and sisters, the world over, when we 
            identify ourselves as a community who are integrally tied to the success of ensuring global 
            food security. In fact, it is our community who have contributed to the possibility of food 
            security in every country, since mankind evolved from a hunter-gather existence. We have 
            watched for many years, as the progression of experts, scientists and development agents 
            passed through our communities with some or another facet of the modern scientific world. We 
            confess that at the start we were unsophisticated in matters of the outside world and welcomed 
            this input. We followed advice and we planted as we were instructed. The result was a loss of 
            the varieties of seeds that we carried with us through history, often spanning three or more 
            millennia. The result was the complete dependence of high input crops that robbed us of crop 
            independence. In addition, we farmers, producers of food, respected for our ability to feed 
            populations, were turned into the poisoners of land and living things, including fellow human 
            beings.”

              Today we are faced with the spectre of ever-widening circles of agricultural poisoning that has 
              seen an exponential increase in non-communicable diseases of farmers and rural folk. Everyone 
              agrees that it is a toxic cause, but as there is no demonstrable causal link, the application of 
              the suspect materials continues unabated. The critical question is; when did this syndrome start 
              to manifest?’ The link to the time of abandonment of traditional agriculture, in favour of the 
              ‘Green Revolution’, and the acceptance of exposure to toxic chemicals, as an agricultural norm, 
              is very clear.
          </P>
          <p>
            The precautionary principle was never invoked. There was no discussion of synergistic effects, 
            bioconcentration and other processes that can render the agroecosystem toxic to the farming 
            populations. Can the erosion of a benign traditional agricultural system that had co-evolved with 
            the biodiversity of this country for over three thousand years to an exotic, toxic, fossil 
            energy-dependent, agricultural system, be seen as more ‘developed’?

            Agriculture is the production of food, medicines and fibre by biological systems. Thus, 
            agricultural sustainability must consider biological sustainability. In a biological sense, 
            sustainability is the potential to recover from perturbation and stress (Conway, 1985). A 
            sustainable system oscillates between inflexible boundary conditions. If the boundary conditions 
            are exceeded, a change in state occurs so that the system loses its original identity and 
            potential. Thus, the sustainability of this system is determined by its boundary conditions as 
            well as its internal dynamics. A biological entity is a product of its temporal and genetic 
            history in varying environments. There are environmental thresholds that cannot be transcended 
            without extinction. In other words, every living thing has limits; be it temperature, water, salt 
            or food, take too much you die, take too little, you die. While acclimatisation often allows an 
            individual, or species, to change its measured thresholds, there exist lethal thresholds beyond 
            which an organism cannot transcend. So, sustainability, when applied in the biological context, 
            will be seen to be defined by inflexible boundaries. If the degree of perturbation or stress makes 
            it transcend the boundaries it loses its identity as an organism or an ecosystem.
        </P>

            Agrarian societies, with long histories, possess the credibility of having sustained themselves 
            successfully under the rigour of survival in a natural world. The looming problem for the future 
            is that the model chosen for sustaining the future global agrarian society is an energy and 
            resource-demanding production system, while no investment is being made to research, building on 
            traditional systems.
        </p>
        <p>
            The burgeoning populations of the future may have no other option than high energy input 
            agriculture to sustain them, simply because we have not invested in examining any other option. 
            Some of the reasoning may lie in thinking that feeding a rapidly growing world population, a s
            ocioeconomic problem, can be resolved through reductionist, technological approaches. However, it 
            is becoming evident that the present resource-expensive system of agrarian production will become 
            increasingly more expensive to maintain. This phenomenon is a result of increasing input costs and 
            decreasing productivity of the land. The predicted global climate effects will also make large 
            areas of monocultures risky. There may be value in examining other options.
        </p>
        <p>
            The value in maintaining diversity is the constant availability of a large number of options. This 
            applies equally well, whether in the case of marketing products or responding to disease or 
            episodic climatic events. The question to be examined by designers of global society is ‘how much 
            diversity can be conserved within the emerging global society? And ‘how much external energy is 
            spent on the production of food? If the lessons learnt at the level of local societies are anything 
            to go by, the goals of sustainability will be achieved best by conserving the diversity of global 
            society and reducing the need for fossil energy to produce food.
        </p>
        <p>
            The simplistic drive of modern agriculture, that accepts food production as merely an output of 
            chemical applied to the soil, has lost touch with reality. Today we witness a radical change in the 
            practice of agriculture. Both the ‘Green Revolution’ and ‘Industrial Agriculture’, with their 
            emphasis on energy subsidies to overcome constraints in increasing production, have brought about 
            an enormous change in the biodiversity and sustainability status of agriculture. The impact of this 
            high energy input, low biodiversity agriculture has not only been felt by the sustainability of 
            ecosystems. It has also impacted the sustainability of cultural systems. The ethics of such changes 
            have largely gone unaddressed.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ethics is loose currency in a world justified only by ‘objective’ science, to justify profits. 
            Yet, it is this very blind faith in ‘objectivity’ that has contributed to the collapse of social 
            relations as seen in the ever-increasing crime rates and social dislocation in ‘developed’ 
            societies. This dilemma is brought into focus by the question posed by Upali Senanayake at the 
            first conference on Agricultural Sustainability, answering a question as to ‘what is so important 
            in maintaining ethics as a value in an objective scientific community’. He answered with the 
            question; “If you are completely ‘objective’ and place no value in ethics, then how can I 
            trust you? By this question, he highlighted the value of ethics in maintaining social contracts.
        </p>
        <p>
            In a country where farmers produce food for themselves, without toxins, while growing food with 
            heavy doses of toxins separately, for the market, it demonstrates a mindset totally devoid of 
            ethics. To meet the right to consume poison-free food, not only do we have to look for policies 
            that safeguard this right, we also need farmers with a sense of ethics and responsibility towards 
            those who consume the food they produce.
